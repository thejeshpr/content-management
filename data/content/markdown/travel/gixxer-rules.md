# 🏍️ Gixxer Rules

You **must follow all the rules below** whenever you use the Gixxer.  
These instructions are for **our own safety** and to keep the bike in top condition — not restrictions, but good habits to make sure it runs smooth and lasts long. 🚦  

---

1. **No rash riding** – Ride responsibly and safely.  
2. **Speed limit: 60 km/h max** – Don’t exceed this limit.  
3. **Don’t give the bike to anyone else** – Strictly for your use only.  
4. **Avoid unnecessary rides** – Use it only when needed.  
5. **Monthly fuel limit: ₹500** – Stay within this budget.  
6. **Handle the bike with care** – Treat it like your own.  
7. **No triple riding** – Only two people allowed.  
8. **Keep the chain clean** – Regular maintenance keeps performance smooth.  
9. **Don’t remove the SIM from the GPS tracker** – It’s for safety and tracking.  
10. **No long drives** – Keep it for short or essential city rides only.  
11. **No long-distance temple runs** – Avoid long religious trips or outstation rides.  
12. **Check engine oil regularly** – Maintain good engine health.  
13. **Keep the bike clean** – Wash and wipe regularly.  
14. **No helmet, no bike** – Always wear a helmet, no exceptions.  
15. **Always park in a safe, designated place** – Avoid no-parking zones or direct sunlight for long hours.  
16. **Report any damage immediately** – Even small scratches or dents.  
17. **Avoid riding in heavy rain or water-logged areas** – Protects electricals and chain.  
18. **Switch off headlight when parked** – Prevents battery drain.  
19. **Don’t rev or race unnecessarily** – Wastes fuel and stresses the engine.  
20. **Don’t sit on the bike when it’s on the stand** – Can damage the stand or cause it to fall.  
21. **Always park the bike inside the gate before sleeping** – If you’ve used it during the day, ensure it’s safely parked inside the compound before you go to bed.  
22. **If the bike was parked in rain, check for water around the fuel tank cap before riding again** – Prevents water from entering the tank and damaging the engine.  
23. **Regularly inspect the bike’s overall condition** – Check brakes, tyres, lights, and other parts to avoid bigger issues later.  
24. **Keep track of service intervals and inform me for service** – Monitor kilometres/date and notify me when the scheduled service is due.
25. **Always Return home by 8PM** - If you are getting late, call and inform in advance.
26. **A message for you:**  
   I’ve taken good care of this Gixxer all along — even thought about selling it a few times, but didn’t, because it means something.  
   Now it’s your turn to keep it running strong and in good condition.  
   Take care of it, and it’ll take care of you on every ride. ❤️🏍️

**👉 Final Note:**  
If you take care of the bike, it’ll serve you well for years — ignore it, and it’ll break down sooner than you think.
