  "markdown_content": "#### Key Points\n\n* **Praise for PM Modi:** Putin referred to PM Modi as his \"friend\" and described him as a \"balanced, wise,\" and \"nationally oriented\" leader, emphasizing the trust in their interactions.\n* **Rebuke to the US:** Putin slammed US efforts to pressure India to halt its Russian crude oil imports, asserting that India \"would never bow to such demands and let itself get humiliated in front of anyone.\"\n* **Economic Rationale for Oil:** He defended India's decision to import Russian crude, calling it a \"purely economic calculation,\" arguing that refusing the supplies would result in losses (estimated around $9-10 billion) that would be similar to the losses faced due to punitive US tariffs (an additional 25% tariff, raising the total tax on Indian exports to 50% in August, according to the article).\n* **Special Relations:** He highlighted the \"special\" relationship between Russia and India, dating back to the Soviet Union's support for India's independence, and noted their close coordination in political relations.\n* **Addressing Trade Imbalance:** Acknowledging the trade imbalance, Putin suggested Russia could increase purchases of agricultural products and medicines from India to help reduce it, noting that financing and logistics are key concerns."
