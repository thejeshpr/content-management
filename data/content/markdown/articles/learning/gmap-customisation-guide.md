Check out some of our favorite ways to tailor your Google Maps journeys.

## 1. Organize lists with your favorite emojis

Saving places to lists is one of Google Maps’ most popular features. To help you keep track of all the cool spots you’ve saved, you can label each list with a fun emoji — like a 🍔 for your “Top Burger” list, or a ⛰️ for your “Future Hikes” list. Your map becomes customized with your favorites or must-try spots — making it super easy to organize and understand the different types of places you’ve saved. Simply start a new list and select **“Choose icon.”**

## 2. Turn your screenshots into your personal travel guide

When you’re planning a trip, you’re likely taking screenshots of places to go—on travel blogs, news articles, or social media posts. Maps can find place names in these screenshots and **save them to a custom list for you**, so you can reference them on the go. It’s like having Maps create a custom itinerary for you!

## 3. Quickly check ETAs for home and work

Knowing exactly when to leave for home and work can be tricky. But with Maps, all you need to do is set up your Home and Work addresses to see real-time ETAs right from your homescreen. You can even customize the icons for each location: select either place, click the three-dot menu, and then “Change Icon.”

## 4. Let Maps plan around your schedule

For a more reliable way to arrive on time, **set your desired arrival time** in Maps. When you're booking a dinner reservation or need to get to an appointment, Maps will tell you when to leave. Tap “Directions,” choose Driving mode, select the three-dot menu, and choose your arrival time.

## 5. Find the best spot for your taste and budget

If you find yourself struggling to pick a dining spot, Maps makes it easier. Search for restaurants or cafés, and tap helpful filters like **“Open Now,” “Accepts Reservations,”** and **“Price”** (you can even set your target price per person!) to tailor your results.

## 6. Customize your ride

Why not make your navigation a bit more “you”? You can swap out the usual navigation arrow for a custom **Navatar**. Tap the navigation arrow when you start your trip to choose your ride. Whether you feel like driving a racecar or cruising in a pickup truck, it’s a fun way to personalize your journey.

## 7. Map your drive, your way

Every driver has different preferences, and Maps lets you choose yours. Before you begin your route, tell Maps if you'd like to **avoid tolls, highways, or ferries**. You can also enable suggestions like **HOV lane routes** or even **fuel-efficient paths** based on whether your vehicle is gas, diesel, hybrid, or electric. Head to **Settings → Navigation** to configure your preferences.

## 8. Helpful direction hints, customized for when you’re on the go

When you’re en route, sometimes you don’t need full instructions, just a quick reminder. With **glanceable directions**, Maps gives you helpful hints right on your lock screen — like “turn right soon,” or “get off at the next stop” — to keep you on track without distractions.
