## 2. PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana

This scheme is inspired by the successful **Aspirational Districts Programme** and is designed to bring focused development to the agriculture sector in specific areas.

### Aspirational Districts Model Success:
The previous Aspirational Districts Programme achieved tangible results in over 100 districts, including:
* Connecting the majority of previously unconnected villages with **all-weather roads**.
* Bringing most children under **full immunization coverage** (up from 17% outside coverage).
* Equipping nearly every school with a **power connection** (up from 15% lacking electricity).

### Selection Criteria for 100 Districts:
The 100 districts for the PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana were selected based on three key parameters:
1.  The level of **agricultural output per unit of land**.
2.  The number of times crops are **cultivated on the same land** within a year.
3.  The availability and extent of **institutional loans** or investment facilities for farmers.

### Strategy (Convergence):
The scheme employs a strategy of **convergence**, bringing together **36 different government schemes** in a unified and coordinated manner under one umbrella. This includes initiatives like:
* National Mission on Natural Farming
* 'Per Drop More Crop' campaign (for efficient irrigation)
* Oilseeds Mission to boost oilseed production
* Special focus on **livestock development** with localized health campaigns.

### Implementation Responsibility:
The scheme places significant responsibility on local government officials, particularly the **District Magistrate or Collector** of each district, to tailor planning according to specific needs. Farmers and district leaders are urged to prepare action plans suited to the local soil and climate conditions.

## 3. Dalhan Atmanirbharata Mission

This mission addresses the need for diverse nutrition, highlighting that pulses are the most significant source of plant-based protein for the largely vegetarian population in India.

| Target Area | Goal/Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nutritional Security** | Boost domestic pulse production to enhance nutritional security and self-reliance. |
| **Area Increase** | Increase the area under pulse cultivation by **35 lakh hectares**. |
| **Focus Pulses** | Increased production of **tur, urad, and masoor**. |
| **Farmer Benefit** | Directly benefit nearly **two crore pulse farmers** across the country. |
| **Procurement** | Ensure a proper system for the **procurement of pulses**. |
