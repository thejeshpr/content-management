# Bengaluru–Magadi Road (SH-85) — KSHIP-III (Package-1C)  
*Status & flyover details at Tavarekere*  
_Last updated: 07 Oct 2025 (IST)_

> **TL;DR**  
> - **Project:** Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project–III (ADB **42513-014**)  
> - **Stretch in focus:** **Bengaluru (NICE Rd) → Tavarekere → Magadi** (SH-85), Package-1C  
> - **Why delays?** Primarily **land acquisition pending**, **encumbrances (tenants/encroachers)**, and **CPR (temples/schools) relocations**.  
> - **Tavarekere:** **A 4-lane flyover is planned** at the junction with **Kengeri–Nelamangala** road; slip/service roads handle local/turning traffic.

## 1) What this project is
- **Program:** _Karnataka State Highways Improvement III (KSHIP-III)_, financed with ADB support.  
- **Packages:** The broader Magadi corridor is split; **Package-1C** covers **Bengaluru → Tavarekere → Magadi**.  
- **Objective:** Upgrade SH-85 geometry, capacity, drainage, and safety; decongest town stretches and segregate through vs. local movements.

## 2) Scope on the Bengaluru–Magadi leg
- **Homogeneous sections** (per DPR):  
  - **HS-I:** Bengaluru → **Tavarekere** (~Km **15+325** to **24+000**)  
  - **HS-IIA:** **Tavarekere → Magadi** (~Km **24+000** to **51+000**; ~27 km)  
- **Built-up constraints:** Building-line width in Tavarekere ≈ **20–24 m**, requiring elevated solution + compact pier design and slip roads.  
- **ROW/COI strategy:** Combination of **direct purchase** under RFCTLARR §46 and **statutory acquisition** under the **Karnataka Highways Act** for the balance.

## 3) Current status & progress (as reported)
> Period referenced: **Jul–Dec 2024** (report issued **Jul 2025**).

- **Land acquisition (LA):** Majority completed via **direct purchase**; **balance land under statutory LA** remained **pending** at period end.  
- **Non-titleholders (NTHs):** Joint verification done; **most assisted/relocated**; **tenants** being covered when their parent parcels are acquired.  
- **CPRs (Common Property Resources):** Multiple **temples, schools, bus stops** slated for relocation/reconstruction; design tweaks (e.g., **compound walls as noise barriers**) in dense stretches.  
- **Grievance Redressal:** GRCs constituted at **district level**; ADB asked for **more regular meetings** and **better MIS updates**.  

**What this means for Bengaluru–Magadi:** Construction pace is **constrained by handover of encumbrance-free land** and **sensitive CPR moves** at town nodes (like **Tavarekere**).

## 4) Why the Bengaluru–Magadi stretch saw delays
1. **Balance LA not handed over** (statutory cases lagging after direct purchase lots).  
2. **Encroachments/tenancies** that need R&R timing aligned with titleholder acquisition.  
3. **CPR relocations** (temples/schools) requiring local consultations & site readiness.  
4. **Grievances** (survey, alignment marking, access management) needing GRC closure.

## 5) Tavarekere junction — flyover plan
- **Facility:** **4-lane divided flyover** across the **Tavarekere** junction where **SH-85** meets **Kengeri–Nelamangala** road.  
- **Purpose:** Keep **through traffic on SH-85** on the elevated level; **turning/local** movements use **at-grade slip/service roads**.  
- **Design choices for narrow town width (≈20–24 m):**
  - **Single-pier** supports to reduce footprint.  
  - **Slip roads under the deck** to minimize additional land take.  
  - **Geometry corrections** (adjacent realignments) to raise safety and comfort.  

> Some media/public-facing write-ups describe a longer four-lane structure with viaduct extensions to address community requests; final lengths vary by design iteration and junction tie-ins.

## 6) Practical notes if you’re evaluating land/works near Tavarekere
- **Verify** latest **COI/ROW** and **parcel-wise LA status** with KSHIP/PIU.  
- **Check** CPR relocation plans & access arrangements near your frontage.  
- **Use GRC**: For measurement/marking disputes or access concerns.  
- **Expect** phased traffic management during flyover construction once land is handed over.
